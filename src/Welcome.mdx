# Welcome to Token 2 Session

I created this library to house components built on the MUI framework to run in NextJS projects. Their goal is to increase the speed with which basic UI's can be turned around with simple props for advanced features.

Create a `[[...slug]]` directory in the area of `./app` that you want your authentication, and add the following lines to `page.tsx`.

```tsx
import AuthRouter from 'jrgcomponents/AuthRouter';
export default AuthRouter;
```
